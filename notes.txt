DEFER
defer in the script tag inside the index.html
defers the loading of the script and doesn't block the loading of the html and gives a little performance boost.


Tailwind script in package.json
Tailwind cli outputs an output css based on the input css 
--watch (automatically updates the changes)


"tw:build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch"
This will observe changes in files which are configured in tailwind.config files
And updates output css again.

Which files will be watched for the changes.
